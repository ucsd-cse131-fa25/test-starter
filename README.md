# Testing for CSE 131

You will be able to see the tests in `tests/` with infrastructure in `tests/infra/mod.rs`. Feel free to modify this and understand how it works. You can also add your own snek files in `tests/` and change `tests/all_tests.rs` to include them in the unit tests.

Run `cargo test` to run the tests.
